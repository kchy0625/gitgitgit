        Everyone, you meet, the children in the street
        Are swaying to the rhythm
        There's something moving in them
        
        There's no place to hide
        So why even try?
        Can't you hear it coming your way? It's here to stay!
        Music in our walk, music when we talk
        It's really something magic, to lose it would be tragic
        Can't feel the sound? Moving through the ground?
        The music makes the world go round!

        You can't stop the music!
        Nobody can stop the music!
        Take the cold from the snow
        Tell the trees don't grow!
        Tell the wind don't blow!
        'Cause it's easier!
        
        No, you can't stop the music!
        Nobody can stop the music!
        Take the spark from love
        Make the rain fall up
        'Cause it's easier to do!
        
        Moving with the wind
        Since the world began
        The beat is gonna getcha, the beat it's gonna getcha
        Music for the blues
        For your dancing shoes
        Can't you hear it coming your way? It's here to stay!
        Moving through the trees
        Buzzing with the bees
        The sound is getting louder
        The sound is getting louder
        Music when we play
        When we kneel to pray
        There's music in the sound of the wind!
        You can't stop the music!
        Nobody can stop the music!
        Take the cold from the snow
        Tell the trees don't grow!
        Tell the wind don't blow!
        'Cause it's easier!
        
        No, you can't stop the music!
        Nobody can stop the music!
        Tell the sun don't shine
        Stop old father time
        'Cause it's easier to do!</p>
